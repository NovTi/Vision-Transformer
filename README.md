## Vision-Transformer-Base-Dophin-Whale-Classifer

## Datset
I use the dataset originally from [“Happywhale - Whale and Dolphin Identification”](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/happy-whale-and-dolphin/overview) Kaggle competition. For a more structured and easy-to-implement data, I found the [resized whale-dolphin images dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rdizzl3/jpeg-happywhale-128x128) (contributed by “RDIZZL3”). The contributor resized the images to 128×128.
It contains 3k training images and 1k testing images with two species: bottlenose dolphin and killer whale.
